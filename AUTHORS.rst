``python-cpanel`` was originally created in the mid 2015 at home,
the bedroom division of the Alireza's place somewhere on planet earth maybe.
As a API wrapper for cPanel which provides a real good API to handle many 
things but somehow it didn't have a production and stable ready Python client.
This project began with Alireza's depression and countless dark whispering
of François‎ in his mind.

The PRIMARY AUTHORS are (and/or have been):

* Alireza Savand <alireza.savand@gmail.com>
* François‎

And here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made ``python-cpanel`` that much better:

* Alireza Savand <alireza.savand@gmail.com>

A big THANK YOU goes to:

* François‎ for convincing Alireza to start the project.
* Guido van Rossum for creating Python.
* People behind cPanel.
