Python cPanel
=============

Python cPanel - The snake ate cPanel API.

``python-cpanel`` was originally created in the mid 2015 at home,
the bedroom division of the Alireza's place somewhere on planet earth maybe.
As a API wrapper for cPanel which provides a real good API to handle many 
things but somehow it didn't have a production and stable ready Python client.
This project began with Alireza's depression and countless dark whispering
of François‎ in his mind.
